Devboots is an advanced backend project designed to cater to location-based bootcamps.
The API serves as a centralized platform for users to effortlessly explore and access comprehensive information about various bootcamps within a specific area.
Notable features include sophisticated search filters, in-depth bootcamp insights, course catalogs, user reviews, and secure authentication.
Developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, the API prioritizes scalability and follows RESTful design principles.

In the future, Devboots will continue evolving. The API, currently running on mock data, will integrate user-generated content and tailor results for specific locations, enhancing its utility and value within the education and tech sectors.
